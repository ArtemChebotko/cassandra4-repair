# Repair Improvements

## Learn how to manage incremental repair in Apache Cassandra®

With the 4.0 release of Apache Cassandra®, there have been improvements to
incremental repair: the process is now more reliable and robust, easier to manage
and ready for use in production.

**In this hands-on lab, you will:**
- Populate a small cluster with data and introduce the need for repair
- Execute incremental repair and observe the data being reconciled between nodes
- Learn how to manage repairs on a Cassandra cluster

_This hands-on lab is available on our [https://www.datastax.com/learn/whats-new-for-cassandra-4](https://www.datastax.com/learn/whats-new-for-cassandra-4) site, where you can find many more resources to help you succeed with Apache Cassandra._
